1. Fixed: In add_exercise_set.php and add_exercise.php are combined in add_exercise_set.php when transferring exercise object ids

2. Fixed: In edit_exercise.php the going back and update feature are fixed

3. Fixed: In edit_exercise.php forces the user to fill in every blank

4. Fixed: In add_exercise_set.php forces the user to fill in every blank

5. Not Fixed: In view_exercises.php the set order is not displaying correctly at times. This is most likely due to reading from the table in the wrong order.
              This bug was fixed by changing the table wb_exercise_set by ordering it from "order by ASC". However, sometimes this problem occurs and sometimes
              it doesn't.

6. Not fixed: In add_exercise_set.php and edit_exercise.php the user can input integer values larger than 11 bit, which is the maximum amount for the fields in
              the table wb_exercise_set. This gives wrong values for what get's queried.
